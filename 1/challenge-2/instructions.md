# Challenge 2 â€” find potential sources and sinks in a different vulnerability
Find out what are the potential sources and sinks in a language of your choice for another vulnerability. For inspiration, look into the Common Weakness Enumeration Database Top 25 or other vulnerabilities in the CWE database.

Hint: if you are having trouble identifying the sources and sinks for a given vulnerability, check out the CodeQL query with that CWE number in CodeQL documentation. Most queries in the documentation contain examples of vulnerable code snippets, which will make it easy to identify sources and sinks.
