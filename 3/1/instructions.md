You will need to set up CodeQL using one of the methods presented in [challenge 2](https://github.com/GitHubSecurityLab/codeql-zero-to-hero/blob/main/2/challenge-2/instructions.md) from CodeQL zero to hero part 2 to run the queries. Remember also to download and [select a CodeQL database](https://github.com/GitHubSecurityLab/codeql-zero-to-hero/blob/main/2/challenge-2/instructions.md#select-codeql-database) - it can be the GitHubSecurityLab/codeql-zero-to-hero database, but you may also choose another project.

Run the above query to find all method calls that are called ‘execute’ and come from the `django.db` library.
