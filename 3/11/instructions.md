Set up MRVA using instructions [here](https://codeql.github.com/docs/codeql-for-visual-studio-code/running-codeql-queries-at-scale-with-mrva/#controller-repository). Select top 10 repositories in the CodeQL extension tab. Choose one of the prewritten queries in your favorite language, right-click in the query file, and select CodeQL: Run Variant Analysis to start variant analysis. If you don’t find anything using that query, it’s likely because the project is already secured against that vulnerability. If you prefer, run one of the bigger lists with 100 or 1000 repositories.
Caution: if you do find true positive vulnerabilities, make sure to verify them first and then report them using the coordinated disclosure process. See our [guide](https://github.blog/2022-02-09-coordinated-vulnerability-disclosure-cvd-open-source-projects/) for reporting vulnerabilities to open source.
