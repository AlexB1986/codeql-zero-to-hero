# Challenge 2 â€” Set up VS Code CodeQL starter workspace

Follow the instructions in the sylwia-budzynska/vscode-codeql-starter-codespace repository, in the [GitHub Codespace section](https://github.com/sylwia-budzynska/vscode-codeql-starter-codespace/blob/main/README.md#github-codespace). In this challenge you will create a codespace â€” a mini virtual machine with VS Code, CodeQL extension and the CodeQL starter workspace preinstalled and load a pre-existing CodeQL database, that we will be querying.

The rest of the challenges will assume that you have the VS Code with CodeQL extension and CodeQL starter workspace set up with a CodeQL database of your choice.

Congrats on completing challenge 2! ðŸŽ‰
